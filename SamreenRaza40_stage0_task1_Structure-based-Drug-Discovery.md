# Structure-Based Drug Discovery's Contribution to the Development of Cancer Treatment

## Background

Cancer is a global health concern. In the twenty-first century, it is one of the leading causes of death. Globally, there were about 9.7 million cancer-related deaths and 20 million new cancer cases diagnosed in 2022 [1]. The critical need for safe and effective treatments is highlighted by the rising incidence and fatality rates. Although creating new drugs is costly and time-consuming, computational techniques are crucial to making the process smoother [1]. Structure-based drug discovery is a key computational technique that is essential for speeding up development and cost efficiency.

## Structure-Based Drug Discovery

Structure-based drug design utilizes known structural information to understand how bioactive compounds interact with their target receptors [2]. Therefore, researchers can use the 3D geometry of proteins to rationally design new ligands de novo with therapeutic benefits [3], [4]. Molecular docking is one method of this approach that evaluates the interaction between a ligand and its target molecule. By identifying a ligand's preferred orientation and minimum free binding energy, molecular docking assists in predicting how well it will bond to its target.

## Examples

One of the first effective medications created in the 1980s using structural information to improve drug design was capoten (captopril), the ground-breaking ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor [5]. 

Similarly, possible NEK7 inhibitors have been found using structure-based drug discovery, which is an important target for cancer treatment. Compound 762 showed a higher binding affinity after virtual screening of benzene sulfonamide derivatives against the NEK7 protein structure, followed by docking with AutoDock Vina [6]. 

Moreover, the development of Crizotinib provides a successful example of the application of structure-based design strategies [7], [8]. Crizotinib, a selective and potent dual inhibitor of c-Met/ALK was approved by the FDA in 2011 [9]. c-Met receptor (also called as HGFR or hepatocyte growth factor receptor) and it is physiological ligand HGF play a crucial role in various cellular processes [10]. A number of studies have shown that the c-Met protein is over-expressed in human cancers [11], [12]. Therefore, it is an interesting and potentially excellent target in the field of oncology.

## Conclusion

Structure-based drug development thus uses comprehensive structural data of biological targets to greatly improve the identification of possible therapeutics. Additionally, this strategy has the potential to produce more effective drugs, which will eventually improve health outcomes and benefit society as a whole.
