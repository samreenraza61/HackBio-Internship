## Introduction

The integration of advanced computational methods, particularly machine learning (ML), has fundamentally altered how drug discovery involves protein-ligand docking. Structure-based virtual screening has benefited considerably from ML regarding reliability and efficacy. This advancement is vital for Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD), which utilizes computational techniques to anticipate binding affinities before conducting clinical trials.

## Recent Developments In:

### Protein-Ligand Scoring Functions

Scoring functions are important for evaluating protein-ligand interactions by examining binding affinities, which involves four categories: 

1. Physical-based (molecular mechanics)
2. Knowledge-based (statistical potentials from experimental data)
3. Empirical (weighted experimental terms)
4. Machine learning (advanced algorithms such as Random Forest and Deep Neural Networks) to improve accuracy.

Docking validation and virtual screening (VS) can be simplified by datasets such as PDBbind, MUV, ChEMBL, etc.

### Machine Learning 

ML has enhanced protein-ligand docking via earlier techniques such as RF-score to innovations like ΔVinaRF20 and ΔVinaXGB, combining traditional scoring with ML for better results. Deep learning methods, such as CNN-based AtomNet and GNN-based PotentialNet, have boosted efficiency.

### Structure-Based Virtual Screening 

The latest advances include enhanced VS methods and a major growth of databases like WuXi GalaXi and Enamine REAL Space. Adaptive docking and ensemble approaches enhance pose prediction by rescoring and filtering, raising hit accuracy, and reducing error rates. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are also employed to refine binding site detection and interaction assessment.

## Results 

Models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and deep learning architectures significantly outperform classical docking methods, particularly in predicting ligand binding poses and affinities. These ML models excelled on benchmark datasets like CASF-2016 and PDBbind, achieving high docking success rates (over 95%) and demonstrating robust performance in cross-docking and large-scale virtual screening scenarios. 

Additionally, the models showed excellent generalizability across diverse datasets, including AlphaFold-predicted structures, indicating their potential for lead optimization in drug discovery.

## Case Study

The review emphasizes the ∆Lin_F9XGB VS protocol on the LIT-PCBA dataset. This demonstrated significant early enrichment (EF1% = 5.55), outperforming methods like IFP and GRIM. This docking variability elucidates the need for target-specific methods.

## Discussion

ML significantly improves docking predictions via advanced scoring functions and large datasets, but it has limitations due to the absence of high-quality data and inconsistencies that reduce generalizability. Enhanced understanding and computational efficiency are required. Future studies need to improve algorithms for large-scale detection while conserving performance.
